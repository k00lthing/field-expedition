# Field Expedition

By reimagining the landscape of a webpage as an unexplored terrain this extension offers an experience  that challenges the conventional web navigation. Upon activation all content elements are blurred into foggy landscape which are to be “discovered” by locating their center point with cursor. The process of unveiling the website content is deliberate and methodical, shifting focus away from content towards the architecture.

This extension is a part of [“Under deconstruction: hidden visuality of the web“](https://k00lthing.github.io/under-deconstruction) master thesis fineshide in 2024 at the [University of Arts Bremen](https://www.hfk-bremen.de/).
